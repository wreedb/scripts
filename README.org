#+TITLE: Scripts
#+AUTHOR: Will Reed

This repository is where I will be storing all of my personal scripts.
Anything from setting a random wallpaper to volume control, notifications,
etc. I tend to write many of my scripts in Perl, since it is very
versatile and shell-centric, but some are just plain shell scripts.
The shell scripts are posix compliant, no bash-isms.
